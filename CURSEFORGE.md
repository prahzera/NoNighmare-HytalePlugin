# NoNightmare — Better Nights for Hytale

## Overview

NoNightmare makes nights smoother and more social in Hytale without changing the core feeling of the game. Instead of requiring every player to sleep, the server can decide a fair percentage, so groups can keep moving together without frustration. A short, configurable delay helps the transition feel natural and avoids abrupt time jumps.

Players always know what is happening thanks to clean, polished chat messages: who is sleeping, when the threshold is reached, and when morning arrives. The experience is designed to be professional, clear, and consistent for all players, from small friend groups to larger servers.

NoNightmare is built to be dependable. The plugin focuses on stability, predictable behavior, and a configuration that is easy to adjust to your server’s needs. It works quietly in the background while giving just the right amount of feedback to your community.

Whether you want a relaxed survival session or a more structured multiplayer server, NoNightmare gives you control over the night cycle without breaking immersion.
